# Two-Sample T-Test with Data Visualization
This Python project performs an independent two-sample t-test to determine whether there's a significant difference between the means of two groups of data. It also includes data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn to help understand the data distribution and compare the means with confidence intervals.

# Getting Started
